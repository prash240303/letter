        <p>Hi Rishita, this is a letter I am writing to let you know how much I love you, both as a friend and as a
          human being. I have been writing letters for the past two years now, and I feel the need to write a letter to
          you as well (since you have been acting I think it's time to write the first letter to you, I am sorry, I
          am a man of long messages and explanations, I can't describe us in 30 words, I need a whole essay). I met you
          by accident, a complete stranger who has shown genuine interest in me, regardless of knowing about me, who
          I was just trusting over some exchanges of words.</p>
        <p>
          I remember that night, when you stayed and talked to me when I was in pain, we talked, we talked real things,
          you talked about your long hair, you talked about your feelings through and through. I remember your long
          paragraphs you giving me hope to do good. I did not intend to like you or develop feelings for you, since I
          felt good enough with Jasmine and did realize that I'm only 21 and I have a big life ahead, people stay for
          short in this phase of life, you might leave by tomorrow, who knows. It's just I like sticking to you, someone
          who would not ignore me and give attention to most boring talk. And my weirdest fantasies as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am glad to have a friend like you. I truly appreciate your efforts despite having trust issues with people
          in long distance. Despite my unattended efforts in April and the turmoil that happened, I blocked you in
          frustration and sadness. I am really sorry for that time. And I probably regret deleting your pictures
          since I had pictures of the screenshots of our very first conversation. I just love that conversation to my
          core heart since for the first time I talked to someone open[-]heartedly and I really loved your response. To
          be continued in the next letter. Aage ki story aglee part meðŸ«¶
